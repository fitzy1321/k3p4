# Ansible Stuff

Still learning ansible and k3s. Scratch space for now

copied the roles from this repo: https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s-ansible

linux:
`pip install ansible`
macos:
`brew install ansible`

`ansible-playbook k3p4_ansible/site.yml -i k3p4_ansible/inventory.yml`

Use mise and `mise.toml` file to control env variables per folder

can also use direnv and .env files, or something similar.

I have mise on my mac, so that's what I'm using.
