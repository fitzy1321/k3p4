# Setting up k3p4 cluster

- I want to control pi cluster deployments with ansible.
- Can I even set up device, files, config, etc? Like the settings on the PI?
  - boot config
  - service updates
  - installing deps, pip, apt, etc. ?

Once k3p4 cluster is all connected

- I want to run docker images across the cluster.
